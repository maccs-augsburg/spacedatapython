Hello this is a test. Currently have working folder somewhere else, I have been meaning to fix this.

1. Copied down my current branch m-branch into a new folder ZZZPyside
2. Set up pip environment (for some reason it doesn't let me do it inside
	MaccsFolder which is the one connected to GitHub)
	
	Ran this command inside /Users/markortega-ponce/Desktop/ZZZPyside

	- pipenv install -r /Users/markortega-ponce/Desktop/ZZZPyside/spacedatapython/MaccsApplication
	
3. Ok, environment working. Dependencies working.
4. I tested on different folder and initialize a git repo with git init command inside
	/Users/markortega-ponce/Desktop/ZZZPyside
	
	I then opened the .git config file from connected repo with "open .config."
	I copied all the files, and copied them over to the .git config file from new folder.
	This worked, but since connected repo has the .config file inside spacedatapython folder,
	and I put it one directory up "/Users/markortega-ponce/Desktop/ZZZPyside"
	it showed as me having deleted all the files. I dont want to delete all previous commits
	so I started over again following the steps above.

5. Ok, all steps repeated, this time I initialized my repo inside the spacedatapython folder
	I tried moving the folder from previous step with BBEdit, but it wasn't letting
	me, so I thought repeating these steps was quicker.

	Ok. I copied over all the files/settings, (reasoning is, nothing has been set by me so far,
	so copying over the settings should work, also have same files and everything.

	Ok, now its not showing me having deleted all the files in the directory.

	Try pushing this up to m-branch.
