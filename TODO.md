# TODO - MACCS Space Data Python #

Here are some ideas for python data processing programs

* Data remover - Given a file and two times, remove all the data records
  between the two times and write out the shortened file.
  
* Axis remover - Given a file, an axis name, and two times, flatten
  out the data value for the given axis between the two times.


- Default to y-axis scaling -- Option for y-axis scaling match 
- Keep GUI running until quit
- Remove pdf, png files from repo
- Rename python files in repo
	git mv oldName.py new_name.py
- Remove old unused python files from repo
	git rm unused.py
- Default pdf to white background
- Use filenames.py file in GUI
- Add Universal Time (Hours) on time axis for plotter
- Change "GeoMagnetic Bz of __stationname__" to "Geomagnetic Bz of __stationname__"
- When time is less than 10 or 12 hours we need to have it more like a time format
- Change date format to Month (3) Day, Year (4) -- Doesn't really matter
- check both pdf and png radiobuttons for saving
- Any time to save a file, do not override file with the same name
- Move station code label and entry box up
- Move yearday label and entry box over (to the right)
- Remove buttons
- Add plot and cancel buttons
- Bind return key to plot button


- plot first and then save later 
	- 3 options: quit w/o saving, save and continue, and save and quit
