# TODO - MACCS Space Data Python #

Here are some ideas for python data processing programs

* Data remover - Given a file and two times, remove all the data records
  between the two times and write out the shortened file.
  
* Axis remover - Given a file, an axis name, and two times, flatten
  out the data value for the given axis between the two times.
