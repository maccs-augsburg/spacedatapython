# TODO - MACCS Space Data Python #

Here are some ideas for python data processing programs

* Data remover - Given a file and two times, remove all the data records
  between the two times and write out the shortened file.
  
* Axis remover - Given a file, an axis name, and two times, flatten
  out the data value for the given axis between the two times.

* Load data from file after opening it for faster graph display

* Go through and see if the is_plottable and entry checks can be refactorered into more simple code

* Either set the window to a fixed size or make aspect ratio always the same so the graph is saved to the same size

* Update layout function refactor again to set hidden a single layout instead of all the singular widgets

* Time ticks and time label and all that is an issue either redo the way we get x time ticks and such or fix it

* add the seperator between the different widget groups on the left side

* MORE COMMENTS ON EVERYTHING // and maybe (should) rename some varibles for better readability

* Rename newgui folder to a more meanifully folder name and rename the new_gui.py file to a better file name
